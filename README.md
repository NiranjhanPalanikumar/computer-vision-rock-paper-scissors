# Computer Vision RPS

## Description
Teachable Machines was used to collect the images and train the model. Teachable Machines is Google's online tool for computer vision applications, where you can capture images using a web camera for each class in your use-case. The images are then used to train a model which can recognise the different classes based on confidence percentage.

There are a total of four classes:
1. Rock
2. Paper
3. Scissor
4. Nothing

After capturing the images and training the model it can be exported as a tensorflow "keras_model.h5" file and the names of the different classes used are stored in the "labels.txt" file.
